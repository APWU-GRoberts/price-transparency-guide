# price-transparency-guide
The technical implementation guide for the TriDepartmental price transparency rule.

Overview
========

This repository set of schemas describing a data format (encoded as JSON, XML, and CSV) for the TriDepartement Price Transparency NPRM.
All machine-readable files must conform to a non-proprietary, open standards format that is platform independent and made available to the public without restrictions that would impede the re-use of that information.

Background
==========

Beginning in 2019, CMS worked to define a schema for sharing data in a machine-readable format that would allow for greater price transparency of both items and services that healthcare providers, health insurance issuers, and self-insured group health plans  provide to consumers before they receive care. These files are intended to be used by technical folks that could then build services, APIs, mobile applications, or anything else the market can think of to empower consumers to make informed decisions when it comes to managing their own care.

Developer Documentation
=======================

Transport mechanism - HTTPS
--------------------------

All machine-readable files must be made available via HTTPS.

Content type - Non-Proprietary, Open Format
-------------------

There are plenty of great formats to work with that will meet the needs for the TriDepartmental Price Transparency NPRM:
* [JSON](https://www.json.org/)
* [XML](http://www.xml.org/)
* [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values)

Examples of proprietary formats that do *not* meet this definition would be:
* [PDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF)
* [XLS/XLSX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Excel#File_formats) 

Public Discoverability
----------------------

These machine-readable files post made available to the public without restrictions that would impede the re-use of that information.

The location of the these URLs *must* be provided over HTTPS to ensure the integrity of the data.

Special Data Types
------------------

Dates should be strings in [ISO 8601 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) (e.g. YYYY-MM-DD).

Health Plan - plan\_\<plan name>.json (e.g. `plan_medicare.json`)
-------------------------
